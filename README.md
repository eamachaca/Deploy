# Commands that I find every deploy, every project, etc. Then, I want to save here for search it here.

`sudo update-alternatives --config php`

It change the path of php's command (for example if i want to use php8 for one project modification I use it to change to php8, and if I need change something in php7.4 I can change with this command and later back to php8 (obviusly running newly this command)). It's a good functionally in my ubuntu desktop
